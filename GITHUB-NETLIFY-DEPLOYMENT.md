## 🌐 Step 3: Verify Netlify Auto-Deployment

### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Go to your Netlify dashboard**: https://app.netlify.com

2. **Find your site** in the sites list

3. **Check deployment status**:
   - You should see a new deployment triggered automatically
   - Status will show "Building" then "Published"
   - This happens because Netlify watches your GitHub repository

4. **Wait for deployment** (usually 2-5 minutes):
   - ✅ Green checkmark = Successfully deployed
   - ❌ Red X = Build failed (check build logs)

### Manual Deployment (If Auto-Deploy Doesn't Work)

1. **Go to Netlify site settings**
2. **Click "Deploys" tab**
3. **Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"**
4. **Or drag your `deploy-package` folder** to the deploy area
