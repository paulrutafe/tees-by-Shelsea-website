## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Files for Upload

**Essential Files to Upload to GitHub:**
1. `public/` folder (contains all website files)
2. `netlify.toml` (Netlify configuration)
3. `package.json` (project dependencies)
4. `README.md` (documentation)

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub

#### Option A: GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it "tees-by-shelsea-ecommerce" 
3. **IMPORTANT**: Drag the entire `deploy-package` folder to preserve structure
4. Ensure you see the folder icon (📁) not individual files
5. Commit with message: "Complete e-commerce platform with video integration"

#### Option B: Git Command Line
```bash
cd deploy-package
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Complete e-commerce platform with video integration"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/tees-by-shelsea-ecommerce.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Netlify

1. Go to [Netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Choose GitHub and select your repository
4. **Build Settings**:
   - Build command: `npm run build` (leave empty if no build process)
   - Publish directory: `public`
5. Click "Deploy site"

**Netlify will automatically use the `netlify.toml` configuration which sets:**
```toml
[build]
  publish = "public"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### Step 4: Configure Payment Processing (Production)

#### Stripe Integration
1. Sign up at [Stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. Get your publishable key
3. Replace the test key in `checkout.js`:
```javascript
this.stripe = Stripe('pk_live_your_actual_stripe_key_here');
```

#### PayPal Integration
1. Sign up for PayPal Developer account
2. Create a PayPal app
3. Add PayPal SDK to your site
4. Configure PayPal buttons in checkout

### Step 5: Testing the Complete System

1. **Browse Products**: Navigate through categories and view videos
2. **Add to Cart**: Test cart functionality with different products
3. **User Registration**: Create a new account
4. **Login/Logout**: Test authentication flow
5. **Checkout Process**: Complete a full purchase flow
6. **Video Playback**: Ensure all product videos load correctly
7. **Responsive Design**: Test on mobile and tablet devices

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding More Videos
1. Upload videos to a CDN or video hosting service

```json
{
  "videos": [
    "https://your-video-url.mp4",
    "https://another-video-url.mp4"
  ]
}

}
```

### Customizing Promo Codes
